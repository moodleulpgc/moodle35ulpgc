# moodle-qtype_kprime

A four option multiple true-false question type for moodle, as introduced by Krebs (1997). Kprime questions consist of an item stem and four corresponding statements or options. For each option students have to decide whether it is "true" or "false". Three different scoring methods are available: “Kprime”, where the student receives one point if all responses are correct, half a point if all save one response are correct, and zero points otherwise; “Kprime 1/0”, where the student receives one point if all responses are correct, and zero points otherwise; and “subpoints”, where the student is awarded subpoints for each correct response.
