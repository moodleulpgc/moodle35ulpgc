# Community

There is a large and growing community of STACK users.  This includes large universities with many teachers and thousands of students, through to smaller setups.  STACK is in regular use in English, Finnish, Swedish, Japanese, German, Spanish and Portuguese.  If you are using STACK please let us know!

A demonstration server is available in Edinburgh:  [https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo](https://stack.maths.ed.ac.uk/demo)

### How can I contribute?

STACK is a community project and contributions are welcome in many ways.

* Helping colleagues write questions, and use online assessment is a good place to start.
* Contributing to the documentation and examples.
* Undertaking projects with your students, and sharing the results.
* Contributing sample questions and question banks.
* Translating the system and sample materials.

Contributions to the code base are very welcome.  This is more difficult, but do contact the developers with ideas.

### How do I keep up to date with announcements about STACK?

We will make announcements about progress and developments with STACK on the [Moodle maths tools](http://moodle.org/mod/forum/view.php?id=752) forum.

### How do I report a bug?

Bug reports are always very welcome.  Please try to make sure it is really not a bug with your question!  Where possible, please export a minimal question and a clear description of how to recreate the bug.  Issues such as this can be reported on [github](http://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues).

### How do I request a new feature?

Please look at the ideas we have for our [development track](../Developer/Development_track.md) and [future plans](../Developer/Future_plans.md).  If your request does not appear here, then please email the developers to discuss it.  Alternatively, you are very welcome to start a new issue on [github](http://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack/issues) to discuss it.

### How do I submit my code changes?

Submit a pull request [https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack](https://github.com/maths/moodle-qtype_stack), or one of the other plugins. If you are not yet familiar with git, please talk to us about your changes, and we will help. Actually, it is probably a good idea to talk to us about proposed changes before you make them in any case.

### How do I share my experiences using STACK?

Please do research and publish your experiences of using STACK with students.  A list of [publications](Publications.md) is available.
